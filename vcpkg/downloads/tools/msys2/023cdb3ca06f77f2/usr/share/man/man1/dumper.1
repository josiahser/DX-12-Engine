.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBdumper\fR
utility can be used to create a core dump of running Windows process\&. This core dump can be later loaded to
\fBgdb\fR
and analyzed\&. One common way to use
\fBdumper\fR
is to plug it into cygwin\*(Aqs Just\-In\-Time debugging facility by adding
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
error_start=x:\epath\eto\edumper\&.exe
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
to the
\fICYGWIN\fR
environment variable\&. Please note that
x:\epath\eto\edumper\&.exe
is Windows\-style and not cygwin path\&. If
error_start
is set this way, then dumper will be started whenever some program encounters a fatal error\&.
.PP
\fBdumper\fR
can be also be started from the command line to create a core dump of any running process\&.
.PP
For historical reasons, unless the
\-n
option is given, after the core dump is created and when the
\fBdumper\fR
exits, the target process is also terminated\&.
.PP
To save space in the core dump,
\fBdumper\fR
doesn\*(Aqt write those portions of the target process\*(Aqs memory space that are loaded from executable and dll files and are unchanged (e\&.g\&. program code)\&. Instead,
\fBdumper\fR
saves paths to the files which contain that data\&. When a core dump is loaded into gdb, it uses these paths to load the appropriate files\&. That means that if you create a core dump on one machine and try to debug it on another, you\*(Aqll need to place identical copies of the executable and dlls in the same directories as on the machine where the core dump was created\&.
